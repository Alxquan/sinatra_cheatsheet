<h1>mkdir man-page</h1>
<p>mkdir

Create new folder(s), if they do not already exist.

Syntax
      mkdir [Options] folder...

      mkdir "Name with spaces"

Options
  -m, --mode=MODE   set permission mode (as in chmod), not rwxrwxrwx - umask
  -p, --parents     no error if existing, make parent directories as needed
      --verbose     print a message for each created directory
mkdir creates the standard entries . (dot) for the current folder and .. (dot dot) for its parent

A folder name that includes spaces can appear in some applications as "Name%20with%20spaces" This is because 20 is the Ascii code for a space in Hex.</p>
